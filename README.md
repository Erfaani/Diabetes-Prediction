# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is a **ML and DL-based classification task** aimed at predicting diabetes in patients based on their medical and demographic information. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains **medical and demographic data** from patients, including:
- **Features**:
  - `age`: Age of the patient.
  - `gender`: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
  - `hypertension`: Whether the patient has hypertension (1: Yes, 0: No).
  - `heart_disease`: Whether the patient has heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No).
  - `smoking_history`: Smoking status of the patient (e.g., never, current, former).
  - `bmi`: Body Mass Index.
  - `HbA1c_level`: Hemoglobin A1c level (a diabetes-related measure).
  - `blood_glucose_level`: Random blood glucose level.
- **Target**:
  - `diabetes`: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1: Yes, 0: No).

Dataset Size: **100,000 rows**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- **Python** (Programming language)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development environment)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep learning model)

## üïäÔ∏è Steps in the Project

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized feature distributions (e.g., age, BMI, HbA1c level).
- Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable (`diabetes`).
- Handled outliers and checked for missing values.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Encoded categorical features like `gender` and `smoking_history` into numerical values.
- Scaled numerical features for consistency across models.
- Split data into **training** (80%) and **test** (20%) sets.

### 3. **Model Training**
Trained and compared the following models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Neural Network (Deep Learning)**

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Visualized confusion matrices for each model.
